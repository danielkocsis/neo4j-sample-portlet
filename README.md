# Neo4j Sample Liferay Portlet


## Introduction

First place I am a developer, I work for Liferay and I love Neo4j. So I thought I could combine these things and develop something to learn and have fun. As I am still a newbie to Neo4j, in the (hopefully near) future I probably continue the development with new stuff, which is going to be more complex and professional.

But until that, this is just a small app that serves demonstration purposes how to use the brand new Liferay Blade development environment along with Neo4j.


## Usage

You can compile and deploy the portlet via using the official Liferay Blade CLI. Regarding the usage of Blade, please see the official [documentation] (https://dev.liferay.com/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/blade-cli).

Once you successfully installed and configure Blade you can deploy the portlet with the `blade gw clean deploy` command from the portlet root folder.


## Version History

- #### 1.0

  - The very fist version of the portlet. It supports only basic Cypher queries with plain text response display.
  - It uses embedded Neo4j JAVA language driver, since there is no available OSGi version yet


## Future plans

As we are progressing with some internal development I am planning to update this project with all the ideas that worth to share publicly.
 
So stay tuned, more stuff is coming! :smile: :wink:
